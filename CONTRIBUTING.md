# Contribution Guidelines

Let's help together and make an awesome list of FPV releated resources!

## Notes

* The links are in no particular order
* Outdated links are removed from time to time (feel free to remove outdated links by submitting a PR)
* Links to open source repository services like GitHub or GitLab are preferred over other sources (like their webpages)

## Requirements

* Linked projects should be relevant to the FPV community
* They do not have to be open source

## Rules

* You are allowed to suggest links to your own stuff
* Look through all the other links and suggestions before submitting your resource to ensure that the list stays free of duplicates
* Do not submit link collections like this one
* Create a pull request containing your addition
* Do not submit new PR's to change your submission, update the existing one ([see this guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md))
